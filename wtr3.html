            India faces “worst water crisis” in history Groundwater Scarcity, Pollution Threaten India’s Health, Economy, Environment, and Food Supply
The country that pumps more groundwater than any other has reached a water supply and food safety reckoning that threatens to upend political and economic stability, and long-term public health.
<p>The country that pumps more groundwater than any other has reached a water supply and food safety reckoning that threatens to upend political and economic stability, and long-term public health.</p>
<p>Hand in hand with the groundwater depletion and contamination, is a food supply “toxic time bomb” of global implications. When irrigation wells go dry, farmers turn to untreated wastewater that is laced with industrial chemicals and human sewage.</p>

    <p>As one villager said, “The water moved from providing life to taking lives.”</p>

    <h2 style="color:darkblue;">1. Water, Crisis and Climate Change in India:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Changes in temperature, precipitation, and humidity due to climate change may have significant long-term
            implications for the quality and quantity of water in India.</li>
            <li>India’s water resources are under increasing pressure from population growth, economic development,
                industrialisation, urbanisation and inefficient water use.</li>
                <li> Glacial retreat in the Himalayas, increasing variability of the Indian summer monsoon as well as sea level
                    rises will jeopardise the water supply for millions of people, affecting not only India but the whole region.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <h2 style="color:darkblue">2. Water crisis and conflict potential:</h2>
        <li>Several internal water disputes already existing in India between states, communities and/or water user
            groups in the domestic and the industrial sectors may be aggravated.</li>
            <li> River systems of the Brahmaputra, the Ganga, and the Indus have a history of regional conflicts and
                cooperation with neighbouring countries and therefore are subjects for major concern.</li>
                <li>These challenges may not only increase the pressure on already existing tensions within water management
                    structures, but also cause new crises and conflicts among water user groups. </li>
    </ul>
