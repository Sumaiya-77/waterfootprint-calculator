    <h1>Time for an Action!</h1>
    <p><strong>Do you know how much water was used to grow your food and to produce your clothes and the things you buy?</strong></p>
    <p>The fashion industry is estimated to be responsible for about 20% of global wastewater and 10% of global carbon emissions. Water is used in various stages of clothing production, including growing raw materials like cotton, dyeing and finishing fabrics, and washing and treating finished garments. Cotton production alone accounts for the majority of the water footprint in the textile industry.</p>
    <p>For example, it takes about 2,700 liters of water to produce enough cotton for one t-shirt. The dyeing and finishing processes also require significant amounts of water. Efforts are being made to reduce water usage and improve water management practices in the industry through initiatives like water recycling, using more sustainable materials, and implementing more efficient production processes.</p>
